  <p>Hi, my name is Ryan. I'm a software engineer/architect. This is my <a href="index.html">blog</a>.</p>

    <h1>Why isn't this site using CSS?</h1>

    <p>I find that there are many benefits to using plain ol' HTML:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed</strong>: websites are natively fast. Like insanely fast. It's what we add that slows them down.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple</strong>: there's nothing more simple than editing HTML and shipping it.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliable</strong>: you can access a simple web page on the <em>weakest</em> device and <em>slowest</em> network. Easy.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimalism</strong>: It's fun creating something within a constrained, minimalist environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This site uses straight up HTML <em>on purpose</em>. At work, of course, I use more than just HTML. After all, I specialize in front-end development.</p>

    <p>Having trouble reading this text? You have some choices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zoom in</li>
      <li>Adjust your default text size in your browser</li>
      <li>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
    </ul>
