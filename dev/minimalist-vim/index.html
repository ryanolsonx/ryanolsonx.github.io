      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Over the past several years, I've been fascinated with "getting things
        done" with less. I believe that a strong software engineer can be
        productive with even the simplest of tools*. I used to
        <em>really</em> customize my .vimrc and install dozens of plugins to get
        all the functionality I thought I need in my Vim text editor.
