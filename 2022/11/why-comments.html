    Hi, my name is Ryan. I'm a software engineer/architect.
    This is my <a href="index.html">blog</a>.

  <h1>// Why Comments</h1>

  <h2>Good Code is Self-Documenting</h2>

  <p>You might have heard this before. In many ways, this is <strong>true</strong>. However, it's become a bit of a cliché. I've seen many engineers repeat this as though it's a mantra. Like many other clichés, there's a lot of truth to it. Is it true? <strong>yes</strong>. Does that mean you should never add comments to your source code? <strong>No.</strong></p>

  <h2>Let's Look at Some Bad Examples</h2>

  <h3>Calling Others Out</h3>

  <p>...Just don't.</p>

  <pre>
  <code>
/* Class used to workaround Richard being a f***ing idiot*/

// This code sucks. Just use it. Call me an idiot later.

// This code is a bit slow because Alex added that stupid hook…
  </code>
  </pre>

  <h3>Describing What You're Doing</h3>
  <p>There are times you might think it's helpful to describe what you're trying to do in comments. This is a good case for writing self-documenting code.</p>

  <p>From <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/cli.js#L21">TypeScripts Codebase</a>:</p>

  <pre>
  <code>
// Enable portable support
bootstrap.configurePortable();
// Enable ASAR support
bootstrap.enableASARSupport();
  </code>
  </pre>

  <p>If you're writing a program that includes user preferences that someone can retrieve:</p>

  <pre>
  <code>
export const getUserPreferences = id => {
  // Get the user
  const user = userService.getUser({ id: 15 });
  // Get users preferences and sort by created date
  const preferences =
    user.preferences.sort(sortBy(‘createdDate’));

  // Return the user preferences
  return preferences;
}
  </code>
  </pre>
