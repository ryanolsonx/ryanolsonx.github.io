    Hi, my name is Ryan. I'm a software engineer/architect.
    This is my <a href="index.html">blog</a>.

  <h1>// Why Comments</h1>

  <h2>Good Code is Self-Documenting</h2>

  <p>You might have heard this before. In many ways, this is <strong>true</strong>. However, it's become a bit of a cliché. I've seen many engineers repeat this as though it's a mantra. Like many other clichés, there's a lot of truth to it. Is it true? <strong>yes</strong>. Does that mean you should never add comments to your source code? <strong>No.</strong></p>

  <h2>Let's Look at Some Bad Examples</h2>

  <h3>Calling Others Out</h3>

  <p>...Just don't.</p>

  <code>
/* Class used to workaround Richard being a f***ing idiot*/

// This code sucks. Just use it. Call me an idiot later.

// This code is a bit slow because Alex added that stupid hook…
  </code>
